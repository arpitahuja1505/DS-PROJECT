# DS-PROJECT
Expression Evaluator and Simulator:-

The code works in two ways.

First, it takes an infix expression and converts it to postfix using stack (made using linked lists), 
and displays all possible cases that can exist for this expression for different values of input using a truth table.
It the displays the output waveform depending on the clock time interval and number of cycles entered by the user. 
It also shows the success cases from the truth table, where the value of the output case is 1. 
It finally, saves the waveform in a file for future reference.

Second, an infix expression is input and the user is asked what each variable means. 
The user is then asked as to what the output expression is supposed to imply. 
Then again, the expression is converted to postfix, evaluated and the truth table is displayed. 
The waveform for the output expression and the success cases are displayed.
Also, using the definitions provided by the user we show as to when the output definition is correct and will happen. 
Now this information i.e. the waveform is saved into a file for future reference.
